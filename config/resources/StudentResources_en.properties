label.credits.warning = The claims of each area are recorded as follows: credits for all approved courses in the area in question + credits for all courses completed to enroll in the same area. <br/><br/> When there are disciplines that may belong to both the area of specialization as the secondary area, the program does not know at the outset of the areas in which the student wishes to make these disciplines, or do not know which areas should assign their claims. <br/><br/> Thus, the program detects that the areas could be determined with the accounting of those claims, in which case assign correctly as intended by the student. <br/><br/> If however none of the areas may be terminated with the accounting for those credits, they will be broken down into two areas (never exceed the maximum power of a group) until the student makes a sufficient number of disciplines in order to complete the areas may be terminated. <br/><br/> Consequently, the total of claims presented here may not correspond exactly to that expected by the student, which however does not mean they are either poorly recorded.
