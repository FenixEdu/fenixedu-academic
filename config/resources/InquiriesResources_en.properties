In these cases it was asked to the delegates that gathered the colleagues opinions and commented and/or interpreted that result. Those comments are available to the teacher and we hope that allow to understand the students insatisfaction reason.<br/>If any of the questions regarding your teaching is in this situation, you'll be asked a comment (that should reflect what, in your opinion, has led to this result and/or if you think that some actions should be made in the next execution of the curricular unit that has an impact over the question the students have raised).

Nesses casos foi solicitado aos delegados que consultassem os colegas e comentassem e/ou interpretassem esse resultado. Foi posteriormente solicitado aos docentes também um comentário nas questões relativas à docência. Esses comentários estão acessíveis ao regente da UC e esperamos que permitam perceber a razão da insatisfação dos estudantes.<br/><br/>Caso alguma pergunta relativa à UC esteja nesta situação, é-lhe igualmente solicitado um comentário (reflectindo o que, na sua opinião, provocou esse resultado e/ou se pensa que devam ser feitas algumas alterações na próxima execução da UC que tenham impacto sobre a questão que os estudantes levantaram). Os seus comentários, assim como o resto do seu relatório são importantes também para o acompanhamento geral da evolução do ensino no IST, pelas Coordenações de Curso e pelos Departamentos e Órgãos Centrais.
