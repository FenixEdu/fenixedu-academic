<!--
	The descriptor-repository is the root element of a repository.xml file.
	It consists of one jdbc-connection-descriptor and at least one
	class-descriptor element.

	The jdbc-connection-descriptor element specifies the default jdbc
	connection for the repository.

	class-descriptor elements specify o/r mapping information for
	persistent classes.

<!ELEMENT descriptor-repository (jdbc-connection-descriptor, class-descriptor+)>
<!--
    The isolation attribute defines the default isolation level for
    class-descriptor that do not define a specific isolation level.

	The version attribute is used to bind a repository.xml file to a given
	version of this dtd. This will help to avoid versions conflicts.

<!--
	The jdbc-connection-descriptor element specifies the default jdbc
	connection for the repository. All class-descriptor elements that do not
	specify their own jdbc-connection-descriptor will use the default jdbc
	connection.
	
	A connection-pool element may be used to define connection pool 
	properties for the specified JDBC connection.

<!ELEMENT jdbc-connection-descriptor (connection-pool?)>
<!--
	The platform attribute is used to define the specific RDBMS Platform.
	This attribute corresponds to a
	org.apache.ojb.broker.platforms.PlatformXXXImpl class.

	The jdbc-level attribute is used to specify the Jdbc compliance
	level of the used Jdbc driver.

	If a jndi-datasource-name for JNDI based lookup of Jdbc Connections is
    specified, the four attributes driver, protocol, subprotocol, dbalias
    used for Jdbc DriverManager based construction of Jdbc Connections
    must not be declared.

    The username and password attributes are used as credentials for obtaining
    a jdbc connections.
    If users don't want to keep this information the repository.xml file,
    they'll have to perform an explicit call to PersistenceBroker.open(...).

	idle objects. When non-positive, no eviction thread will be launched.
	
	minEvictableIdleTimeMillis
	specifies the minimum amount of time that a connection may sit idle
	in the pool before it is eligable for eviction due to idle time.
	When non-positive, no connection will be dropped from the pool due
	to idle time alone (depends on timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis > 0)
