diploma.supplement.eight.body.full=The Framework Law on the Education System (Law no. 46/86 of 14 October, \
amended by Law no. 115/97, dated 19 September and Law no. 49/2005, dated 30 August, republished and \
renumbered in annex to the latter) establishes the general legal framework of the Education System. \
The educational system comprises three levels: basic, secondary and higher education. \
Pre-school education is for children aged between 3 and the age of entering basic education, and is \
universal for children from the age of 5. Basic education is universal, compulsory and free and comprises \
three sequential cycles, the 1st lasting four years, the 2nd lasting two years, and the 3rd lasting three years. \
Secondary education comprises a three-year cycle (corresponding to the 10th, 11th and 12th years of schooling) \
and must be completed by schoolaged young people, an obligation that ceases at the age of 18.\n\
\n\
National Qualifications Framework\n\
The National Qualifications Framework (QNQ) was adopted in 2009. It comprises the formal qualifications of \
all education and training subsystems as well as the non-formal qualifications derived from \
professional experience within the framework of the National Qualifications System. It includes \
eight levels of qualification, following the levels and descriptors of the European Qualifications Framework \
(EQF). The QNQ is referenced to the EQF.\n\
\n\
Higher Education Structure\n\
Portuguese higher education includes university and polytechnic education. University education is provided by \
public and private university institutions while polytechnic education is provided by public and \
private non-university institutions. Private higher education institutions are subject to prior recognition by the \
competent Ministry.\n\
\n\
Licenciado degree\n\
Both university and polytechnic education institutions award the degree of licenciado. \
In polytechnic education, the cycle of studies leading to the degree of licenciado normally lasts six curricular \
semesters corresponding to 180 ECTS credits. In exceptional cases covered by national or European Union \
legislation, it may last up to seven or eight curricular semesters with up to 240 ECTS credits of student work. \
In university education, the cycle of studies leading to the degree of licenciado ranges from 180 to 240 \
ECTS credits, and normally lasts from six to eight curricular semesters. In the 1st cycle of studies the degree \
of licenciado is awarded to those who pass all the course units of the licenciatura study programme, \
therefore obtaining the required number of credits. The degree of licenciado corresponds \
to the level 6 of the QNQ and EQF.\n\
\n\
Mestre degree\n\
Both university and polytechnic education institutions award the degree of mestre. The cycle of studies \
leading to the degree of mestre ranges from 90 to 120 credits, and normally lasts from three to four \
curricular semesters. In exceptional circumstances resulting from a stable and consolidated practice in that \
specific field at international level, it may amount to 60 ECTS credits and last two semesters. \
In polytechnic education, the cycle of studies leading to the mestre degree must ensure predominantly that the \
student acquires a professional specialization. In university education, the cycle of studies leading to the \
mestre degree must ensure mainly that the student acquires an academic specialization through research, \
innovation or development of professional competences. In university education, the mestre \
degree may also be awarded upon completion of an integrated cycle of studies, ranging from 300 to 360 \
ECTS credits and usually lasting 10 to 12 curricular semesters, in cases where the access to the practice of a \
certain professional activity depends on that length of time in accordance with European Union legal standards \
or results from a regular practice consolidated within the European Union. Within this cycle of studies, the \
degree of licenciado is awarded to those who have obtained 180 ECTS credits corresponding to the first six \
curricular semesters. In the 2nd cycle of studies, the degree of mestre is awarded to those who \
have passed all the course units of the mestrado study programme, and who have publicly defended an original \
dissertation, project work or traineeship report, therefore obtaining the required number of credits. \
The mestre degree corresponds to the level 7 of the QNQ and EQF.\n\
\n\
Doutor degree\n\
The Doutor degree is awarded by universities and university institutes to those who have passed all the \
course units of the Doutoramento study programme, when applicable, and who have publicly defended an \
original thesis. It may also be awarded on account of a coherent and relevant set of research works or, in \
the field of the arts, on a work or a set of works or achievements. The doutor degree corresponds to the \
level 8 of the QNQ and EQF.\n\
\n\
Cursos Técnicos Superiores Profissionais\n\
The técnico superior profissional diploma is awarded upon completion of a non-degree higher education \
cycle of studies entitled curso técnico superior profissional (CTeSP). It corresponds to a short cycle of studies \
within the cycle of studies leading to the licenciado degree. The CTeSP are provided by polytechnic higher \
education institutions as well as polytechnic organic units integrated in universities. \
The CTeSP have 120 ECTS credits and normally last four curricular semesters including general, scientific and \
technical subjects, as well as a training period at the workplace.\n\
\n\
Other diplomas\n\
Higher education diplomas may also be awarded following the partial completion of a cycle of studies. In \
such cases, the chosen title must differ from the title of the final award of the applicable degree. \
Diplomas may also be awarded for non-degree courses, some of which are regulated, e.g. postgraduate \
specialization courses in Nursing or supplementary courses in Nursing or Teaching.\n\
\n\
Access conditions\n\
Admission to higher education institutions is subject to numerus clausus.\n\
\n\
Admission to the first cycle of studies General regime\n\
National and foreign students wishing to apply to the 1st cycle of studies leading to the licenciado degree \
through the general regime must fulfil the following conditions:\n\

- Have taken the entrance exams required for the programme the student wishes to attend with a mark \
equal or higher than the minimum required (there are higher education institutions that accept foreign tests or exams);\n\
- Have fulfilled the prerequisites (when applicable) of the programme the student wishes to attend.\n\
An annual competition is held by the Directorate-General for Higher Education for admission to public \
higher education through the general regime. Institutional competitions are held for \
admission to private higher education through the general regime.\n\
\n\
Special conditions\n\
Besides the regime geral (general regime), there are special conditions that apply to top-level athletes, \
Portuguese citizens on an official mission abroad, national or foreign diplomatic staff, permanent staff of \
the Portuguese Armed Forces, and scholarship holders within the framework of cooperation agreements \
agreed by Portugal. An annual competition is held by the Directorate-General for Higher \
Education for admission to public higher education through the special conditions.\n\
\n\
Special competitions\n\
Besides the general regime and the special conditions, there are special competitions for applicants holding \
specific qualifications, thus opening higher education to new publics in a lifelong learning perspective, namely:\n\

The relevant bodies of each higher education institution are responsible for the regulations, application \
requirements and selection criteria for admission to this cycle of studies. The access and admission to the \
integrated cycle of studies leading to the mestre degree are governed the norms applicable to the access and \
admission to the 1st cycle of studies leading to the licenciado degree.\n\
\n\
Admission to the third cycle of studies\n\

10-20 final classification on a numerical scale from 0 to 20, as well as its equivalent in the European scale \
of comparability of classifications. The academic degree of doutor is assigned a final classification pursuant \
to the regulating standards approved by the awarding university or university institute.\n\
\n\
WHERE APPLICABLE\n\
Former higher education structure\n\
\n\
Degree programmes\n\
Prior to Law no. 49/2005, dated 30 August, and ensuing adoption of the regulatory principles for the creation \
of the European Higher Education Area:\n\
- The degrees of bacharel, licenciado, mestre and doutor were awarded in university education;\n\
- The degrees of bacharel and licenciado were awarded in polytechnic education;\n\
- Diploma to licenciatura programmes, organised in two stages, the first leading to the bacharel degree and \
the second to the licenciado degree, could be provided in polytechnic education. The first stage lasted six \
semesters and the second lasted two to four semesters;\n\
- The programmes leading to the bacharel degree usually lasted three years, but under certain conditions \
could be one or two semesters shorter;\n\
- The programmes leading to the licenciado degree usually lasted four years, but under certain conditions \
could one to four semesters longer;\n\
- The programmes leading to the mestre degree had a maximum length of four semesters;\n\
- Degree programmes were not assigned a given range of ECTS credits.\n\
The former degrees remain valid as there is no matching mechanism or automatic conversion from the former \
to the current degrees. The degrees and diplomas prior to the Bologna Process implementation were \
given the following correspondences within the framework of the QNQ:\n\
- The bacharel and licenciado degrees correspond to level 6;\n\
- The master degree corresponds to level 7;\n\
- The doutor degree corresponds to level 8.\n\
\n\
Cursos de Especialização Tecnológica\n\
Higher education institutions were given the deadline of 31 December 2016 to conclude the provision of \
post-secondary courses aimed at specialized professional training, entitled Cursos de Especialização \
Tecnológica (CET). The CET range from 60 to 90 ECTS credits and include subjects in \
general, scientific and technical areas, as well as a training period at the workplace. \
The completion of a CET implies a technological specialization certificate providing a level 4 professional \
qualification, in accordance with Council Decision 85/368/CEE of 16 July, which corresponds to a level 5 \
qualification within the framework of the QNQ.
